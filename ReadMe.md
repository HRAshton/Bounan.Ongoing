# Bounan Ongoing

Monitors and tracks ongoing anime series by their downloaded episodes,
ensuring that newly available episodes are registered with downstream services.

## Actions:

- When a new video is registered, it:
  - if the anime is an ongoing, updates list of registered episodes
  - otherwise, takes no action

- 4 times a day:
  - re-checks ongoing anime for newly available episodes and notifies AniMan about them
  - cleans up completed ongoings from the tracking table in 2 cases:
    - if all expected episodes have been downloaded
    - if the ongoing has been inactive for a month

## Database:

- Bounan Ongoing Table (DynamoDB):
  - animeKey (partition key, derived from `myAnimeListId + dub`)
  - myAnimeListId (number)
  - dub (string)
  - episodes (set<number>)
  - updatedAt (ISO string)
  - createdAt (ISO string)
